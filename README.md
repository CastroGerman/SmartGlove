# Test IMU
This test consists of getting used to how [MPU6050](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf) works and how to get data from it. 
You will be able to get data directly from it [registers](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6500-Register-Map2.pdf) and make few corrections like subtracting offsets and normalize it values.
